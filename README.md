# Crowdfunding Trends with Microsoft Excel

The attached dataset holds information related to Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign donations.  After cleaning and organizing the massive dataset, I took advantage of vlookups and pivot tables to build interactive charts and graphs.  These visualizations help to inform the user of donation trends by crowdfunding platform.

There is also a color scale dependent upon successful (green) or failed (red) donation campaigns.
